**Chopped Fingers Reviews** is a reviews websites intended for things I (or someone close to me) use.
The reviews are for products I owned for _at least_ one year, if not more, and provide a wide range of opinions
and use-cases of the product.

Same as [Amir-X](/amir-x), this site was built with **Drupal 7** and a __Zen-based drupal theme__.

The 'chopped' part of the name was given as I drew the sites's logo (in Inkscape!) and showed it to a friend.
The friend said that the hand looks as if it had its fingers chopped off, so I embraced the notion and named
the site accordingly.
