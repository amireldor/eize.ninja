Hello. **[Amir-X](http://amir-x.com/)** is my personal website. I avoid calling a blog because I don't like that word.

I write mostly technical stuff I encounter when configuring servers, Vim, and whatever I
encounter in the world that is of computers, software, and agony (or glee!).

The site is sadly built with **Drupal 7**, and I intend to change that in the future to something
more suitable for the task, and less demanding in administration. Wordpress? Maybe. Ideally
it would be a project I would do with Python, Go, or Ruby, you know... the sexy languages.

I built the theme I use (the one with the birthday capybara, codename "simcapy") with **unsemantic**
if I recall correctly, and it looks just fine under my mobile phone, so I'm happy with that. It's based on the
**Zen drupal theme.** The theme is also subject to change, into something less cheerful, yet happy enough.
