					<td><p><b>BERSERKORE</b> is a magnificent side-scroller game where you can't jump
						and you shoot red enemies. All of this while bombs of might fall upon
						you from the darkened skies.</p>
						<p><a href="https://github.com/amireldor/berserkore-windows">(sources)</a>
						BERSERKORE was built with C++, using <a href="http://sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>, a YAML parser (yaml-c++),
						and some Boost libraries. An overkill. This version is for Windows, as I
						could not build nad check it on Linux or MAC, but the code is very portable and
						I will most probably build those versions some day which is not too far into the future.</p>
						<p>BERSERKORE is actually a remake of an old game I hacked when I was a child.</p>
