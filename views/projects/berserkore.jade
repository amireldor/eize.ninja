            **BERSERKORE** is a magnificent side-scroller game where you can't jump
            and you shoot red enemies. All of this while bombs of might fall upon
            you from the darkened skies.

            **BERSERKORE** was built with C++, using [SFML](http://sfml-dev.org/), a YAML parser (yaml-c++),
            and some Boost libraries. An overkill. This version is for Windows, as I
            could not build nad check it on Linux or MAC, but the code is very portable and
            I will most probably build those versions some day which is not too far into the future.

            **BERSERKORE** is actually a remake of an old game I hacked when I was a child.
